# nvim

The configuration of neovim in particular can be subject to a lot of changes. As such, this
repo is seperated from [abxh/dotfiles](https://github.com/abxh/dotfiles) and added as a
submodule to exclude minor changes and keeping things working and relatively stable.

Neovim is very extensible editor with a evolving ecosystem of plugins. There are many
ways to the do the same thing. Some are better and others are worse in some aspects.

I think it's important to roll out your own configuration, rather than to use a
preconfigured neovim distro.

Do not regard this neovim configuration as some sort of a neovim distro. If you are looking
for a neovim distro, then consult the internet and use the most popular ones. They are better
maintained and they are probably configured better.

If you want something to look like the screenshots, use the [ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim](https://github.com/ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim)
with the colors specified [here](https://github.com/abxh/nvim-config/blob/main/lua/plugins/gruvbox.lua).

Otherwise, feel free to copy what you like of my configuration.
